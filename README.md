## Introduction

Here I will be sharing (and updating) a portfolio of my current projects, and I will be using this assignment from The Odin Project as a resume of sorts.

#### Features

Here I'm replicating an assignment from The Odin Project.  Using a few images of a similar page design, I wrote out my code using vanilla JavaScript.
